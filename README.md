Looking for an extremely lightweight iTunes App Store? Use this lightening fast app to search the iTunes app store and once you find what you want, tap directly through to the asset in the App Store or bookmark the app for later downloading.

User experience flow:

1. Tap in the search bar to activate the keyboard - type in a search term or name of the app of interest
2. In a table view, the results from Apple's servers will be displayed in a text list of app names
3. Tap on the item you are interested in
4. In the detail view, the following information is displayed: App name in navigation bar, app icon, developer name, rating, price, download size in megabytes and the full app description.
5. Tap "iTunes" button to go directly to the app store download page
6. Tap "Mark" to bookmark the app, saved to Core Data. A check to Core Data is made to ensure you don't already have the app bookmarked, and prompted accordingly.
7. Tap the "Marked" navigation item to show your bookmarked apps. This list of apps is displayed in a table view as well.
8. Swipe right to delete any saved apps which are no longer needed
9. Tap on a list item to go through to a modified detail view controller. In this detail view the user can tap through to the iTunes App Store as well.

The idea for this app came from the frustration of the heaviness, and bloated sluggishness of the current iTunes App Store - for maximum speed, heavy elements have been avoided.

Enjoy!
